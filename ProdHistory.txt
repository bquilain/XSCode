Production 0: early February 2017

------------------------------------------------

Requests for next prod:
- correct the peaks in the d-mu distribution 
  -> they are due to proton misidentified as a muon

- add a variable bool IsGrid for the WM to know if the true vertex is
scinti or water
  -> I have added a bool IsSciBkg for that.

- redefine FSIInt
  -> FSIInt=12 is added (scintillator bkg)
  -> Redefinition of CCother to isolate CC1pi0

- use the same physics list in both MC (in prod 0: QGSP_BERT 3.3 in PM
and QGSP_BIC 3.3 in WM)
  -> QGSP_BERT 3.3 for the WM as well

- check OOFV weights
  -> a sand muon loop has been added to have more stats

- MVA-based PID
  -> available and ready for PM

Ready for Production 1 : May 2017

-------------------------------------------------

Production 2: some bugs fixed + NEUT 5.3.3
Started July 2017

- Nue, Numubar, INGRID, Wall events are from 5.3.6 file

- MIP retuned for WM
- Bayesian PID build for WM as a (mu+pi)CL, also (mu+pi)CL for PM
- Retuning of NEUT nominal available with option -t
