Requests for next prod:
- correct the peaks in the d-mu distribution
- add a variable bool IsGrid for the WM to know if the true vertex is
scinti or water
- redefine FSIInt
- use the same physics list in both MC (in prod 0: QGSP_BERT 3.3 in PM
and QGSP_BIC 3.3 in WM)
- check OOFV weights
- MVA-based PID
